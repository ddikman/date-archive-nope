# Date Archive Nope

This WordPress plugin removes the date archive pages, completely.

## Description

The date archive pages (ie `/2024/04/03`) can be useful at times but they are thin content and can be harmful for SEO, not to mention, if you have a blog post a day for two years, that is 700+ single-page archive pages that eats up your crawl budget.

Plugins such as AIOSEO [has options to disable indexing](https://aioseo.com/docs/setting-the-seo-title-and-description-format-for-author-and-date-archives/#controlling-seo-for-author-and-date-archives) of these pages but they still exists and if linked to, they will get crawled even if they don't get indexed.

This plugin will wipe the date archives, giving you 404s instead.

## Installation

Upload the plugin zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/ddikman/date-archive-nope/releases) to your wordpress site. That's it.

## Usage

Once activated, the plugin works automatically with no configuration required.
